culPlugins collects forked Mirador 3 plugins:

- mirador-hinting-sidebar (which is a fork of the core Mirador sidebar components)

... and a number of Columbia Libraries-developed plugins into a [monorepo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo) for deployment. Forked plugins include the original license, with additional copyright statements as appropriate.
